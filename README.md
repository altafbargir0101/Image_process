# Image_process

Welcome to the Image_process repository! This repository contains Python tools I created while working at a startup company to automate image processing tasks that were previously done manually. These tools are designed to work with image CSV points (pixel points) for tasks such as cropping images, drawing lines, and drawing quadrilaterals on images. The tools are open for everyone to use.

## Contents

- **Python Scripts**: Various scripts for image processing tasks.

## Usage Instructions

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

The scripts use the following libraries:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import re
import warnings
```

### Note
Keep your image and this Script in same folder. Also you need CSV poins (pixel points) in x.y,x1.y1,x2.y2,... format.
